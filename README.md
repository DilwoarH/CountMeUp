## References

### Libraries Used
```
Express
- Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features 
for web and mobile applications.

Lodash
- Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
- Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:
    - Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
    - Manipulating & testing values
    - Creating composite functions

Sails.js
- Sails.js is a web framework that makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.
